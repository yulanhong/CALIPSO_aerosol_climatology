# cray enviroment should use gnu
1. check the output
check_output.pro
===== 2019/07/17 ====
1. update the depolarizaiton ratio and backscatter pdf from previous column average to each layer
2. add lidar ratio of clouds and aerosols
3. update the multiple aerosols and clouds to obtain aerosols above and below clouds
==== 2019/07/25 ====

2. add the two-way transimittance for aerosol below clouds
=== 2019/07/31 ====
1. add ocean and land mask to inaero & isolate aerosol numh
2. can output day and night data
3. change the CAD threshold as a global parameter
====2019/08/21 ====
1. ==== add color ratio ====
 color ratio pdf, and lidar ratio vs. color ratio mean and stddev
====2019/10/16====
add quanlity screening filters: |CAD score|>=20, cirrus filter, Extinction QC (0,1,18,16), Extinction uncertainty (99.99 1/km and samples below are rejected),isolated 80km horizontal resolution, negative values,  in new folder: aerosol_cloud_overlap_screen

===2020/03/31/========
1.move to new version to exclude the profiles out of quanlity control
2. negative tau value is not recorded any more
3. do not record cloud phase any more
4. delete the top-base 2d histogram,and top-aero cloud gap 2d histogram
5. adding vertical occurrence, backscatter, extinction profiles4. delete the top-base 2d histogram
6. delete the transimittance and tau uncertainty
7. delete the deporalization ratio pdf
8. delete land vs sea
===2020/04/04/==========
1. do not consider cloud uncertainty 

=== 2020/04/12======
1. delete the colratio and lidratio pdf, which can be derived from lidcol array
2. delete backscatt pdf, which can be derived from scatdep

===2020/07/01======
1. add writing the filters out

===2020/07/13=====
1. add day vs night and land vs ocean options 

==== 2021/02/17/ ====
1. add the pdf of backscatter to obtain median value of backscatter

==== 2021/03/18/====
