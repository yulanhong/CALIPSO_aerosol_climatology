1.start_caliop.pro to triger the program
2.main_caliop_parallel.f90 one processor processes one day file and then write result out
main_caliop_parallel_copy1.f90 one processor processes one day file,add all result together to get monthly result, then write result out 

opacity_flag 1--opaque, 0--transparent
test cad score > 20, aerosol frequency is spread over midlatitude storm track, which looks like liquid clouds.
check cad score > 50, result pattern not change (resutls look right see Julia Fuchs and Jan Cermak 2015 paper)
